			<h1> About </h1>
				<p>Modern life has become much easier thanks to the ease in communication and information sharing by the internet technologies. There is no doubt that the internet has made our life easier and more convenient. Born out of ARPANET project, the global network of connected computer systems have become a common electronic gateway for people around the globe to communicate and share information. It has enabled people to communicate from virtually any part of the globe and has transformed the world into a small global village.<br/><br/>
Internet provides a variety of services that helps normal people and businesses communicate and share information alike. World Wide Web (WWW), email, internet telephony etc. are some of the popular application on top on internet. Among these services, WWW is the most popular and primary application program that billions of people use in their daily life. It has changed their life tremendously, it has changed how people get and consume news and other information. Before the advent of internet, the sole medium of gaining news was through newspaper or through people. But now one can easily visit a news site and get the breaking news instantly or view tutorials to various things. It has given people a medium not only to consume information but also given equal freedom to share and express people’s opinion through blogs and social networks. Internet has truly make getting information convenient and easy.<br/><br/>
Talking about the convenience about sharing opinions and ideas we deeply felt a need for a medium for students and clubs at Slippery Rock University to express their thoughts and ideas freely with no restriction. So, we are focusing on building a blog site solely for SRU students to share their voice. There a saying, “The more we share, the more we learn”. So, we want to provide a medium for our fellow SRU friends to share what they have learned that day or ideas or opinions about any improvement that needed to get attention. We are well aware of the social medias like Facebook, Twitter but not all SRU students are friends or connected in social medias. So, sharing of ideas and opinions are limited to the only people and group that a student is associated with in social medias. Other people are unaware of the ideas that he/she is sharing. So, there is a deep necessity of a common ground for SRU students to come at and share their stories.</p>
